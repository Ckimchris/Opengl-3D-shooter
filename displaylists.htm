<p></font><font size="4"><strong>What are Display Lists?</strong></font><font size="3"></p>
</font>

<p><font size="3">Display lists are another technique to improve performance. You can make
some gl* calls and OpenGL will save them and their parameters. After this you can execute
those calls by calling the display list. This causes less overhead in the functions, and
another aspect is, that there is no (time expensive) data transfer. </font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>When should I use Display Lists?</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Display lists are mostly used to store static objects. Note that it
wouldn't be possible to render such an object like the &quot;sphere&quot; from the vertex
array tutorial, because you cannot change any data in a display list (of course you can
apply transformations to he whole list, but not to certain vertices). They are also used,
when you have to compute their vertices - instead of computing them each time you render
your scene, you can also store the results of your calculations in a display list. It
would also be possible to use vertex arrays - ok. But there are some other differences:
Vertex arrays don't need as much memory, sometimes you really have to care for that
aspect. But display lists are generally a bit faster than vertex arrays. And one important
thing is, that you cannot change state variable in vertex arrays (except the color, NVects
and so on, of course). That means, it would be a bit more difficult to render an object
with vertex arrays, when you have to use different material properties or want to change
the modelview matrix. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Another field, where display lists are used, is when you write some
simple text (or even 3d-text):You could create a list for each letter and write a routine,
that calls the right list for each letter in a string.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Or you could create a list to make changes of state variables faster.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>How can I use Display Lists?</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">First you have to get a number for your lists. This is done by <em>Num =
glGenLists(1)</em>. Now&nbsp; you can call <em>glNewList(Num, GL_COMPILE),</em> make the
calls that shall be stored in the list and the finish the list with <em>glEndList()</em>.</font></p>
